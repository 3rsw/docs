= Building for the Inforce IFC6410 =
To use default build config, use ''inforce_'' configurations.

To make a bootable image you will need the Android bootimg tool.   On Debian, do

{{{
apt-get install android-mkbootimg
}}}
Then when you have built your app, you can create a boot image   with these commands (substituting the name of your output file   for sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064):

{{{
> ramdisk
objcopy -O binary sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064 sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064.bin
mkbootimg --kernel sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064.bin --ramdisk ramdisk --base "0x82000000" --output boot.img
}}}
== Serial Console ==
The serial port on the Inforce is at RS232 voltage levels.   Connect to a normal serial port, then use minicom or screen to   talk to it, at 115200 baud, no parity, eight bits.

= Booting seL4 =
Force the board to boot into fastboot mode by shorting pins 26   and 30 on the large header â€” see [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150526213626/http://mydragonboard.org/2013/forcing-ifc6410-into-fastboot|This   blog post]] for details.

You will see something like this on the serial port:

{{{
Android Bootloader - UART_DM Initialized!!!
[0] welcome to lk

[10] platform_init()
[10] target_init()
[130] USB init ept @ 0x88f4e000
[170] fastboot_init()
[170] udc_start()
[300] -- reset --
[300] -- portchange --
[470] fastboot: processing commands
}}}
You can then do:

{{{
fastboot boot boot.img
}}}
and should then see the output from your app.

= CAVEATS =
The timer driver is not complete, which means that two of the tests   in seL4test will fail.
