== Running seL4 on the Raspberry Pi 3 ==

Please also find a step by step guide to running seL4 on your Raspberry Pi 3 [[https://research.csiro.au/tsblog/sel4-raspberry-pi-3/|on our blog]] (and check out the rest of the blog too!)

== Serial connection ==
Serial TX and RX are located at GPIO pins 14 and 15 respectively (See Hardware schematic above) 
== Reset ==
Short the jumper marked "RUN" between the expansion header and USB sockets to perform a soft reset of the CPU.

== SD card setup ==
The PI boots from the first FAT32 partition on the SD card. Where files are specified, they should be located in the root directory of this partition.
