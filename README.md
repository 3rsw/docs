# seL4 Documentation site.

Currently WIP

To build and host locally:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update

# If this doesn't work see: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/
bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
#   Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
#   Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
Or with docker: 
```
docker run --network=host -v $PWD:/host -w /host -it ruby bash -c 'bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve'
```

### Makefile and JEKYLL_ENV=production version

Jekyll provides an environment flag for providing some content only in a production environment.

One way we use this is to show data generated by rules in the Makefile and saved in \_data/generated.yml.
If you want to serve the site locally in production mode there are make rules for this.  You will need
to call the make rule to generate the \_data/generated.yml also.

### WCAG 2.0 AA conformance

There is a make rule to check conformance to all testable statements from the guidelines. `make check_conformance`.
It requires the site to be hosted locally (using `make serve`) and a local server of
[Automated Accessibility Testing Tool (AATT)](https://github.com/paypal/AATT).

`make check_conformance` will output a file named `conformance_results.xml` which is a junit testsuite output file that will
contain a testcase for each generated html file of the site.  A make rule `make check_conformance_errors` will grep for failing testcases
and output the html page name.  The idea here is to detect if any pages are failing and then manually using the AATT tool's webinterface
to check what parts of the page violate the guidelines.
