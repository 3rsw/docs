# Internal Libraries


We have four major collections of libraries developed in house:

> -   '''\[\[<https://github.com/seL4/seL4_libs%7CseL4_libs>\]\]''':
>     seL4 specific libs that were started before the open sourcing of
>     seL4
> -   '''\[\[<https://github.com/seL4/util_libs%7Cutil_libs>\]\]''': OS
>     independent libs that were started before the open sourcing of
>     seL4
> -   '''\[\[<https://github.com/SEL4PROJ/seL4_projects_libs%7CseL4_projects_libs>\]\]''':
>     seL4 specific libs that were started after the open sourcing of
>     seL4 - new libraries should go here.
> -   '''\[\[<https://github.com/SEL4PROJ/projects_libs%7Cprojects_libs>\]\]''':
>     OS independent libs that were started after the open source of
>     seL4 - new OS independent libs should go here.

Please see the specific readmes of each library collection for more
detail.

# External libraries


We keep external libraries in non-condensed repos so that it is trivial
to pull in upstream changes.
