# Stand-alone seL4 builds

<!--excerpt-->

This page contains documentation for building the seL4 kernel standalone --- without a userlevel or any loaders that run before the kernel. This is typically used for verification or where a project wants to fully control userlevel and prekernel initialisation. We only maintain verification configurations for kernel only builds.
