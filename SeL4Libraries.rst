= Internal Libraries =

We have four major collections of libraries developed in house:

 * '''[[https://github.com/seL4/seL4_libs|seL4_libs]]''': seL4 specific libs that were started before the open sourcing of seL4
 * '''[[https://github.com/seL4/util_libs|util_libs]]''': OS independant libs that were started before the open sourcing of seL4
 * '''[[https://github.com/SEL4PROJ/seL4__projects_libs|seL4_projects_libs]]''': seL4 specific libs that were started after the open sourcing of seL4 - new libraries should go here.
 * '''[[https://github.com/SEL4PROJ/projects_libs|projects_libs]]''': OS independant libs that were started after the open source of seL4 - new OS independant libs should go here.
 
Please see the specific readmes of each library collection for more detail.
