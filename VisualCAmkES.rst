VisualCAmkES, also known as Visualisation of CAmkES, is a tool that allows one to visually understand a CAmkES system, how it works and how the different components are connected together. This makes understanding easier and more intuitive than traversing CAmkES code. An example of a graph generated by this tool is shown below

Currently this program loads in a top-level camkes file and generates a graph from it. It also lets the user interact with the graph (zoom, pan and move nodes). 
The tool is a foundation for a CAmkES IDE. To create a CAmkES IDE, one must first be able to display a current CAmkES system and allow interaction. And that is what this project does. Since it was clear that this project should become an IDE in the future, the code has been written with that in mind.

VisualCAmkES is currently on the [[CAmkESNext]] branch only
